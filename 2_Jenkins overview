### 3. Jenkins Overview

#### Jenkins Dashboard

The Jenkins dashboard is the main interface where you can manage jobs, configure settings, and monitor builds. It consists of the following sections:

- **People**: View and manage users.
- **Build History**: View the history of builds.
- **Manage Jenkins**: Access configuration settings and manage plugins.
- **My Views**: Create custom views to organize jobs.

#### Jenkins Nodes

Jenkins can distribute build jobs across multiple machines, called nodes. This helps in managing and balancing the load, especially in large projects. Nodes can be added and configured from the “Manage Jenkins” -> “Manage Nodes and Clouds” section.

Jenkins jobs are the fundamental units of work in Jenkins. Each job can be configured to perform specific tasks such as building code, running tests, and deploying applications. Jobs can be created from the dashboard by clicking “New Item”.
